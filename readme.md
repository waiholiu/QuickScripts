# What is this

This is just a collection of scripts you can run globally on your system to make it easy to do things.

# How to set this up

- Clone repo 
- Run the deploy.ps1 file to copy the scripts to the bin directory.
- add the bin directory to the PATH environment variable.   
- Then you can just run this using Win-R and type the bat file name - newrepo, reminder etc.


# Scripts

## New Repo

Type "newrepo" and it'll create a new repo in a specific directory, git init it then boots up VS Code so you can start working on it.

Reminder to set the base directory in the script.

## Reminder

This script allows you to quickly set a reminder

In the Windows Run command, you can type 

``` 
reminder 5 "email the client back"
```
It will remind you in 5 minutes to email the client back.
